I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Netherlands Cancer Institute](https://www.nki.nl) (NKI) and the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl) (UvA), where I am a part of Jan-Jakob Sonke's [radiotherapy department](https://www.nki.nl/research/find-a-researcher/groupleaders/jan-jakob-sonke/) and Jonas Teuwen's [AI for Oncology lab](https://aiforoncology.nl/).

My current research interests are **quantifying uncertainty in deep learning** and, more concretely, improving the **calibration of image segmentation models** in order to improve their reliability in a medical setting. One of the ways in which I try to understand these problems is through the lens of [**conformal prediction**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_prediction), a framework that can provide statistically valid prediction intervals in a model-agnostic manner.

I recently completed a PhD in **nonperturbative quantum gravity** under the supervision of [prof. Renate Loll](https://www.hef.ru.nl/~rloll/Web/title/title.html) at the Radboud University Nijmegen, where I mainly investigated **curvature observables** in the context of **Causal Dynamical Triangulations** (CDT). During my time there, I co-created open-source codebases for performing Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of CDT in [two](https://github.com/JorenB/2d-cdt) and [three](https://github.com/JorenB/3d-cdt) dimensions.

Furthermore, I spent a short time as a junior researcher in the **infectious diseases modeling** group at UMC Utrecht's Julius Center. Here I collaborated with dr. Alexandra Teslya and prof. Mirjam Kretzschmar to construct an **agent-based network model** for simulating societal lockdowns imposed in response to infectious disease outbreaks.
