I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Netherlands Cancer Institute](https://www.nki.nl) (NKI) and the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl) (UvA), where I am part of Prof. Jan-Jakob Sonke's [radiotherapy department](https://www.nki.nl/research/find-a-researcher/groupleaders/jan-jakob-sonke/) and Dr. Jonas Teuwen's [AI for Oncology lab](https://aiforoncology.nl/).

My current research interests include **quantifying uncertainty in deep learning** and, more concretely, improving the **calibration of image segmentation models** to enhance their reliability in a medical setting. I approach these challenges through the lens of [**conformal prediction**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_prediction), a framework offering statistically valid prediction intervals in a model-agnostic manner.

I recently completed a PhD in **nonperturbative quantum gravity** under the guidance of [Prof. Renate Loll](https://www.hef.ru.nl/~rloll/Web/title/title.html) at the Radboud University Nijmegen. My work primarily involved investigating **curvature observables** in the context of **Causal Dynamical Triangulations** (CDT). During this period, I co-developed open-source codebases for performing Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of CDT in [two](https://github.com/JorenB/2d-cdt) and [three](https://github.com/JorenB/3d-cdt) dimensions.

Additionally, I briefly worked as a junior researcher in the **infectious diseases modeling** group at the UMC Utrecht's Julius Center. Collaborating with Dr. Alexandra Teslya and Prof. Mirjam Kretzschmar, I helped develop an **agent-based network model** for simulating societal lockdowns in response to infectious disease outbreaks.
